# JS - CNFT Sales Twitter Bot
A Cardano NFT Twitter bot that monitors sales for a collection. It pulls and monitors data from [OpenCNFT](https://opencnft.io/) and posts any new sales on Twitter. The bot was created with Javascript + Node.js. It is very similar to a Python verison I built: [CNFT Sales Twitter Bot](https://github.com/OishiMula/cnft_twitter_bot).<br>

# Requirements
* A [Twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/) - Will require [Elevated Access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products/elevated) for full twitter functions.
* Javascript + Node.js
